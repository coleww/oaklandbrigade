#Landing page for _Code for KC_

* This is the codebase for the Production site at http://codeforkc.org
* Note that branch `gh-pages` is what shows on production codeforkansascity.org. Master does nothing.

##How to Code for This Repo
Option A: Fork, Edit, then Pull Request when ready.
Option B: If in the KC Brigade and you have write access to repo: Develop/test in your own branch, preferablly a feature-named-branch, and once it's ready for production, merge into gh-pages, which auto deploys to GitHub pages for codeforkansascity.org. 

Also, it's nice if you merge/commit to gh-pages, that you please let the team know.
